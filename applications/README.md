# Applications

Multi-agent AI applications for financial services. This directory contains three categories of applications, each serving a different adoption path.

---

End-to-end full-stack solutions for specific FSI use cases. Each implementation is a complete, self-contained project with its own frontend, backend, infrastructure, and deployment pipeline.

| Implementation | Domain | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| Trade Surveillance | Capital Markets | Real-time trade monitoring, pattern detection, and regulatory alerting |
| Intelligent Document Processing | Operations | Automated document ingestion, classification, extraction, and validation |

## FSI Foundry

A collection of multi-agent POC implementations spanning banking, insurance, capital markets, and operations — all built on one shared foundation of infrastructure and backend code.

- One codebase, three deployment patterns — EC2/ALB, Step Functions, or AgentCore Runtime
- Two framework implementations per use case — LangGraph/LangChain and Strands
- Shared foundations — adapters, base classes, Terraform modules, Docker configs, agent registry
- Deploy any use case with a single interactive script

34 use cases across 6 FSI domains:

| Domain | Count | Examples |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Banking | 10 | KYC Risk Assessment, Agentic Payments, Customer Service, Customer Chatbot |
| Risk and Compliance | 6 | Fraud Detection, Credit Risk Assessment, Compliance Investigation |
| Capital Markets | 9 | Investment Advisory, Trading Assistant, Earnings Summarization |
| Insurance | 3 | Customer Engagement, Claims Management, Life Insurance Agent |
| Operations | 3 | Call Center Analytics, Post Call Analytics, Call Summarization |
| Modernization | 3 | Legacy Migration, Code Generation, Mainframe Migration |

## App Factory

Declarative markdown blueprints that describe complete agentic applications end-to-end — agent logic, infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and tests — designed to be fed into AI coding assistants to generate fully functional apps.

## Which Should I Use?

| Scenario | Recommended Path |
|----------|-----------------|
| Exploring multi-agent patterns across FSI domains | FSI Foundry |
| Building multiple use cases on shared infrastructure | FSI Foundry |
| Generating a new application from a specification | App Factory |

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# Deploy an FSI Foundry use case (interactive)
cd fsi_foundry
./scripts/main/deploy.sh

# Follow the project-specific README
```
