Complete audit trail of the investigation process documenting every step taken. This provides full transparency and reproducibility of the investigation methodology.

Each audit trail entry must be an object containing:
- timestamp: ISO 8601 string (e.g., "2026-02-06T10:30:00Z")
- type: string - one of: "decision", "agent_routing", "thinking", "tool_call", "validation", "data_access", "computation"
- content: string - human-readable description of what was done and why
- metadata: object with detailed context (see below)

CRITICAL - Include these specific details in metadata:

For DATABASE QUERIES (type: "data_access"):
- tool_name: "gateway_query_database" or similar
- table_name: Name of table accessed (e.g., "flagged_trade", "trade_details")
- sql_query: Complete SQL query executed (full text, not truncated)
- query_purpose: Why this query was needed (e.g., "Retrieve flagged trade details for alert")
- row_count: Number of rows returned
- execution_time_ms: Query execution time if available

For PYTHON CODE EXECUTION (type: "computation"):
- tool_name: "execute_python" or "code_interpreter"
- code_snippet: Complete Python code executed (include all logic)
- purpose: What the code calculates or validates
- input_summary: Brief description of input data
- output_summary: Brief description of results
- variables_used: Key variables and their values

For AGENT ROUTING (type: "agent_routing"):
- agent: Name of agent being invoked (e.g., "data_contract_agent", "trade_analyst_agent")
- purpose: Why this agent was selected
- input_summary: What information was passed to the agent
- expected_output: What you expect the agent to return

For TOOL CALLS (type: "tool_call"):
- tool_name: Exact name of tool called
- tool_input: Complete input parameters (as JSON string or object)
- tool_output_summary: Brief summary of what the tool returned
- purpose: Why this tool was needed

For DECISIONS (type: "decision"):
- decision: What was decided
- rationale: Why this decision was made
- alternatives_considered: Other options that were evaluated
- workflow_state: Current state in investigation workflow

For THINKING (type: "thinking"):
- reasoning: Your thought process
- context: What information led to this thinking
- next_steps: What you plan to do based on this reasoning

This detailed audit trail enables compliance officers to:
1. Reproduce the investigation by re-running the same queries and code
2. Validate the investigation methodology
3. Understand the agent's decision-making process
4. Audit data access for regulatory compliance
5. Debug issues if results are questioned
