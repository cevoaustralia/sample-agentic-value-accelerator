## Plan

Strategic guidance and frameworks to facilitate AI transformation across enterprise leadership personas. These documents help business, technology, and risk leaders identify, evaluate, and prioritize agentic AI use cases that deliver measurable value.

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [**Use Case Discovery Guide**](plan/UseCaseGuidance.md) | 8-step framework for enterprise leaders to identify high-value agentic AI use cases — covers bounded autonomy, measurable outcomes, and governance across industries |

> More strategic planning resources coming soon — persona-specific playbooks (CEO, CIO, CTO, CFO, CRO, CDO), ROI frameworks, and industry-specific adoption guides.

---

## Platform

The AVA Control Plane is a web-based management layer for deploying and operating agent applications on AWS.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [**Backend**](platform/docs/architecture/platform-architecture.md) | FastAPI API — template catalog, packaging engine, deployment orchestration, test runner |
| [**Frontend**](platform/control_plane/frontend/README.md) | React + TypeScript UI — browse use cases, deploy with one click, view logs, test agents |
| [**Infrastructure**](platform/control_plane/infrastructure/README.md) | Terraform modules — ECS, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, CloudFront, CodeBuild |
| [**Templates**](platform/docs/templates/README.md) | 8 deployable starter templates — foundations, agent runtimes, and patterns |

### Starter Templates

| Template | Pattern | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Foundation Stack | Foundation | **Langfuse deployment** — provisions the Langfuse v3 observability server (plus required networking) that every other template and use case sends traces to. Deploy this first, once per account/region; accessible afterwards from the Observability tab. |
| Strands AgentCore | Managed Runtime | Strands agent on Bedrock AgentCore with Langfuse observability |
| LangGraph AgentCore | Managed Runtime | LangGraph agent on Bedrock AgentCore with Langfuse observability |
| Tool-Calling Agent | Single Agent | Agent with dynamic tool invocation, registration, and error handling |
| RAG Application | Retrieval | Retrieval-augmented generation with vector search and knowledge base |
| Multi-Agent Orchestration | Multi-Agent | Orchestrator pattern with specialized sub-agents collaborating on complex tasks |

### Deployment Paths

The Control Plane offers two ways to deploy any use case, backed by the same CodeBuild pipeline:

| Path | Best For | How It Works |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Quick Deploy (S3)** | Business users, standard deployments | Backend packages the use case source from the template catalog into a ZIP, uploads to S3, and triggers Step Functions. No Git knowledge needed. |
| **Deploy from Git (CodeCommit)** | Developers, custom forks, team collaboration | User selects a pre-seeded CodeCommit repo from the UI. CodeBuild clones the repo and deploys. Push code to the repo to customize before deploying. |

Git-path repos are pre-seeded from the FSI Foundry registry by a one-time script (`scripts/seed-codecommit.sh init`). Users don't need to create repos manually.

## Agent-as-a-Service

Managed autonomous agents you deploy into your own AWS account — either Amazon's Frontier Agents or your own Custom Agents built on Bedrock AgentCore.

### Frontier Agents

| Agent | Domain | Deployment | Status |
|-------|--------|------------|--------|
| [AWS DevOps Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devopsagent/latest/userguide/about-aws-devops-agent.html) | Incident Response & SRE | [Terraform](platform/control_plane/aaas/frontier_agents/devops/iac/terraform/README.md) &#124; [CDK](platform/control_plane/aaas/frontier_agents/devops/iac/cdk/README.md) &#124; [CloudFormation](platform/control_plane/aaas/frontier_agents/devops/iac/cloudformation/README.md) | Available |
| [AWS Security Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityagent/latest/userguide/what-is.html) | Application Security | Terraform, CDK, CloudFormation | Coming Soon |
| [Kiro](https://kiro.dev) | Developer Productivity | Local IDE (not IaC-deployed) | Coming Soon |

One-click deployment from the Control Plane UI that provisions the agent space in your account. Monitor your build process and access Operator View post-deployment.

[**Browse Frontier Agents &#8594;**](platform/control_plane/aaas/frontier_agents.json)

### Custom Agents (Coming Soon)

Build your own autonomous agent on Bedrock AgentCore — choose a model, attach tools, configure memory and guardrails, and deploy to a managed runtime.

---

## Capabilities <sub><i>(Coming Soon)</i></sub>

Composable building blocks agents reach for at runtime — governed once, reused across every application and autonomous agent. Three primitives:

| Capability | What it is | Examples |
|------------|------------|----------|
| **Tools** | Everything agents *call* | MCP Gateway, Code Interpreter, Web Browser, API Connector, Notifications, custom Lambda/OpenAPI tools |
| **Knowledge** | Everything agents *read from* | S3 data sources, RDS/JDBC connections, Bedrock Knowledge Bases (vector + hybrid retrieval), document stores, streaming feeds |
| **Prompts** | Reusable, versioned templates | System prompts, response templates, evaluation rubrics, guardrail clauses — backed by Amazon Bedrock Prompt Management |

Each primitive is registered once with access control, lineage, and audit trail, then attached to agents at deploy time. Update a prompt or re-index a knowledge base without redeploying the agent.

---

## Secure

Safety controls every deployed agent passes through — built on Amazon Bedrock Guardrails and extended with platform-level policy management.

| Component | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Guardrails** | Content filters (hate, insults, sexual, violence, misconduct, prompt attack), PII detection and redaction, denied topics, word filters, and contextual grounding. Manage templates from the Control Plane; attach one or more to any agent at deploy time. FSI-tuned presets provided (FSI Standard, Market Surveillance, Customer Service). | **Available** |
| **Policy** | Governance frameworks and compliance policy management — map controls to frameworks, track exceptions and waivers. | Coming Soon |

---

## Govern <sub><i>(Coming Soon)</i></sub>

A new pillar focused on the governance story regulators and executives expect — one command-center view plus deeper workspaces for the teams that live in each domain.

| View | What it shows |
|------|---------------|
| **Command Center** | AI Trust Stack posture across 7 layers (infrastructure, data, model, application, agent, access, governance); fleet KPIs; 30-day trust & guardrail trend; agent × risk heatmap; model inventory snapshot; compliance coverage for NIST AI RMF / ISO 42001 / NYDFS Part 500 / EU AI Act / SR 11-7 / SOC 2; Cost & FinOps summary; recent activity feed |
| **Model Registry** | Full inventory with owner, risk tier, eval score, SR 11-7 attestation board, EU AI Act classification, approval pipeline per model, and drift signals. Click any model for the full Model 360 card |
| **Cost & FinOps** | FinOps health score, spend velocity, cost by model, 30-day cost vs budget, BU budgets, 12-month forecast with three growth scenarios, unit economics, chargeback statement, commitment / Provisioned Throughput planner, and optimization opportunities |
| **Audit & Incidents** | Searchable timeline of guardrail events, incidents, approvals, deployments, and config changes with per-event evidence drawer (trace links, CloudTrail records, exportable signed bundles) |

All pages are mock-data today to demonstrate the operating model; real data sources (Bedrock, CloudTrail, Cost Explorer, Langfuse) are buildable against existing APIs.

| **AaaS** | [Frontier Agents Registry](platform/control_plane/aaas/frontier_agents.json) | Catalog entry that drives the deploy UI — agent metadata, supported IaC types, parameters |
| **Observability** | [Foundation Stack (Langfuse v3)](platform/docs/templates/foundation-stack.md) | Langfuse v3 + OpenTelemetry on ECS Fargate (bundled with required networking). Deploy once per account/region; every use case auto-provisions its own Langfuse project against this foundation. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with [Bedrock model access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html) (Claude models enabled)
- AWS CLI >= 2.28.9
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Python >= 3.11
- Node.js >= 22
- Docker with buildx support

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/ava
cd ava

# Copy environment config
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your AWS credentials and region
```

**Choose your path:**

The Control Plane is the recommended entry point — once deployed, it can CI/CD-deploy every application including FSI Foundry use cases, reference implementations, templates, and app factory from its UI. The Foundry and reference implementation scripts remain available for standalone plug-and-play use if you'd rather skip the Control Plane.

**Recommended — deploy the Control Plane, then use its UI for everything:**

| Step                               | Command | Required? |
|------------------------------------|---------|-----------|
| 1. Deploy the Control Plane        | `cd platform/control_plane/infrastructure/scripts && ./deploy-full.sh` | Required |
| 2. Seed CodeCommit (enables the "Deploy from Git" path in the UI) | `cd platform/control_plane/infrastructure/scripts && ./seed-codecommit.sh init` | Optional — only for the Git deploy path |
| 3. Docker Hub (Authenticates to pull from Docker Hub) | `cd platform/control_plane/infrastructure/scripts && ./setup-dockerhub-auth.sh` | Optional — Only for LangFuse setup. [Instructions](platform/control_plane/infrastructure/scripts/README.md#setup-dockerhub-authsh) |

After step 1, user can the Control Plane UI to deploy any FSI Foundry use case or reference implementation — no further CLI work needed.

**Alternative — deploy standalone (without the Control Plane):**

| Goal | Command |
|------|---------|
| Deploy a single FSI Foundry use case from the CLI | `cd applications/fsi_foundry && ./scripts/main/deploy.sh` |
| Deploy a reference implementation from the CLI    | See [applications/reference_implementations/](applications/reference_implementations/README.md) |

> **⚠️ Model Access:** AWS accounts that have not used a legacy model in the last 30 days will receive an error when calling that model, resulting in **"Error: No Response"** in the frontends. Check the Model Catalog to select the right model.
